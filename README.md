This is repo is for learning image classification for the purpose of understanding how human facial features can be put to use for classifying faces for a medical condition.  
Dataset is available on kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/autistic-children-data-set-traintestvalidate
The main purpose is to check the performance of simple  Neural Network models and te usage of pretrained models to achieve a better accuracy.
This code can no way be put to use for actual medical diagnosis as the authenticity of the images is unknown.
